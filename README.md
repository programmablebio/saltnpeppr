Targeted protein degradation of pathogenic proteins represents a powerful new treatment strategy for multiple disease indications. Unfortunately, a sizable portion of these proteins are considered “undruggable” by standard small molecule-based approaches, including PROTACs and molecular glues, largely due to their disordered nature, instability, and lack of binding site accessibility. As a more modular, genetically-encoded strategy, designing functional protein-based degraders to undruggable targets presents a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we integrate pre-trained protein language models with recently-described joint encoder architectures to devise a unified, sequence-based framework to design target-selective peptide degraders without structural information. By leveraging known experimental binding protein sequences as scaffolds, we create a Structure-agnostic Language Transformer & Peptide Prioritization (SaLT&PepPr) module that efficiently selects peptides for downstream screening.
